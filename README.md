Text Summarizer App

A simple yet powerful AI-powered web app that takes any news article or blog post and summarizes it into 3 concise sentences — built using Hugging Face Transformers, Flask, and Gradio UI.

 Motivation

This project was built to showcase effort, creativity, and curiosity in building something AI-powered from scratch — not perfection. I wanted to see how far I could go by combining public AI tools, documentation, and experimentation to build a working product within a short time.

Even though it’s simple, this project helped me learn:

How to integrate Hugging Face models in a Python backend.

How to deploy AI apps using free platforms like Hugging Face Spaces.

How to design a user-friendly Gradio interface for text processing tasks.

 What It Does

Takes any text input (like a blog or news article).

Automatically summarizes it into 3 meaningful sentences using a Transformer model.

Displays both original text and AI summary instantly.

 Tech Stack

Python 3.10+

Transformers (Hugging Face) — pre-trained summarization model.

Gradio — to create the interactive web interface.

Flask (optional) — for backend deployment.

Render / Hugging Face Spaces — for free deployment.

 Installation

Clone this repository and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/text-summarizer.git
cd text-summarizer
pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the app locally:

python app.py


It will open automatically in your browser! 

 Example

Input:

“Artificial Intelligence is transforming industries by automating complex tasks, enabling data-driven decisions, and unlocking new possibilities for creativity and efficiency.”

Output Summary:

“AI is revolutionizing industries through automation and intelligent insights. It enables better decision-making and boosts innovation. This marks a major shift in how technology impacts society.”

 Deployment

You can run this project for free using:

Hugging Face Spaces
 (recommended)

Render.com (simple Flask app deployment)

To deploy on Hugging Face Spaces:

Create a new Space.

Choose Gradio as the SDK.

Upload your files (app.py, requirements.txt, README.md).

Hit Deploy 

 Extra Effort

Added error handling for empty text.

Used a fine-tuned summarization model from Hugging Face (facebook/bart-large-cnn).

Kept the UI clean, minimal, and beginner-friendly.

Documented my process and reasoning clearly .

 What I Learned

How to read and use Hugging Face model documentation.

How to structure a simple AI project for deployment.

That even small projects can teach a lot when done with purpose.

Future Improvements

Add a feature for multi-length summaries (short / medium / long).

Allow URL-based article fetching.

Support for multiple languages using translation models.
